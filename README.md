# C++ Exercises

These are some c++ exercises for the Algorithms and Programming subject at my Bachelor in Computer Science program.
The goal here is to solve 11 problems using only mathematical expressions to manipulate the values. All specifications will be written down here:

1) Create a program that prompts the user to enter their name and displays the message "Hello" followed by the name entered by the user.

2) Design an algorithm to calculate how many horseshoes are needed to equip all the horses purchased for a stable.

3) John received his salary of R$ 1200.00 and needs to pay two overdue bills (C1 = R$ 200.00 and C2 = R$ 120.00). Since the bills are overdue, 
John will have to pay a penalty of 2% on each bill. Create an algorithm that calculates and shows how much of John's salary will remain.

4) The "Gostosura" snack bar sells only one type of sandwich, which includes two slices of cheese, one slice of ham, and one hamburger patty. 
Knowing that each slice of cheese or ham weighs 50 grams, and the hamburger patty weighs 100 grams, create an algorithm where the owner provides the 
quantity of sandwiches to be made, and the machine informs the amounts (in kilograms) of cheese, ham, and meat needed for purchase.

5) Create a program that calculates fuel expenses for a trip. The program should ask the user for the distance to be traveled in kilometers, 
the car's fuel consumption in kilometers per liter, and the price per liter of fuel. As a response, the program should inform the amount in R$ to be spent on fuel for the trip.

6) The grading system for a certain course is composed of three exams. The first exam is weighted 2, the second is weighted 4, and the third exam is weighted 6. 
Create a program that asks the student for their scores, calculates, and displays this student's final average.

7) Class C consists of 60 students, and class D consists of 20 students. Write an algorithm that reads the percentage of failing students in class C, 
the percentage of passing students in class D, calculates and writes:
a) The number of failing students in class C.
b) The number of failing students in class D.
c) The percentage of failing students relative to the total number of students in both classes.

8) A store sells bicycles with a 50% markup on their cost price. It pays each salesperson 2 minimum wages per month, plus a 15% commission on the cost price of each bicycle sold, 
divided equally among them. Write an algorithm that reads the number of employees in the store, the minimum wage value, the cost price of each bicycle, the number of bicycles sold, 
calculates and writes: the final salary of each employee and the (net) profit of the store.

9) Create a program for a bank self-service terminal that dispenses cash withdrawals. The program should ask the user for the amount to be withdrawn and should display on the screen 
the quantity of each bill to be delivered to the user. The program should always try to use the smallest number of bills possible. The machine only has R$ 10, 5, and 1 bills. 
You should display the variables containing the quantity of bills in the following order: 10, 5, 1.

10) Develop an algorithm that prompts the user for a 5-digit number and displays it in reverse.

11) Create a program to calculate and display the checksum digit of a bank account. The user should input the account number, which must be a 4-digit integer. 
The checksum digit will be calculated as follows:
• Step 1: Add up all four digits.
• Step 2: Multiply all four digits.
• Step 3: Subtract the multiplication result (step 2) from the sum result (step 1).
• Step 4: The checksum digit will be the remainder of the division of the subtraction result (step 3) by 9.
